# Changelog

All notable changes to the DisplayXR Unity plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.9] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Set Per-Monitor DPI Awareness V2 before runtime init for correct weaving (#41)
  - `SetThreadDpiAwarenessContext(DPI_AWARENESS_CONTEXT_PER_MONITOR_AWARE_V2)` ensures `GetClientRect` returns physical pixels
  - Fixes Leia SR weaver interlacing mismatch on DPI-scaled Windows displays

## [0.4.8] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Revert display Y-flip (separate issue), add canvas/texture size diagnostics (#41)
  - Native `set_canvas_rect` now logs exact pixel values sent to runtime
  - Game View overlay shows canvas/surface/UV/screen/scale/draw sizes for debugging

## [0.4.7] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Revert native D3D12 blit to simple copy, flip at display via UV coords (#41)
  - Atlas content is Y-flipped (Unity D3D12 convention), weaver interlaces it Y-flipped, and the display flips it back via Rect(0, vMax, uMax, -vMax)
  - All three flips are consistent — no native row-by-row flip needed

## [0.4.6] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- D3D12 atlas blit: row-by-row Y-flip copy for correct weaver orientation (#41)
  - Unity RenderTextures on D3D12 store content Y-flipped in native memory
  - Copy each row to the reversed Y position in the swapchain image so the weaver receives correctly oriented content for lenticular interlacing

## [0.4.5] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Revert to Graphics.CopyTexture — Graphics.Blit Y-flip broke rendering (#41)
  - Reverts to the working v0.4.2 atlas copy path
  - Y-flip will be handled separately (native D3D12 blit or projection matrix)

## [0.4.4] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Simplify Y-flip blit: remove GL matrix manipulation that may have broken D3D12 (#41)

## [0.4.3] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Fix D3D12 Y-flip: blit atlas with vertical flip before copying to bridge texture (#41)
  - Unity RenderTextures on D3D12 are Y-flipped in native memory
  - Use `Graphics.Blit` with `scale(1,-1)` to flip before bridge copy

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Revert canvas rect to physical pixels — runtime uses them as GPU viewport dims (#41)

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Fix canvas rect DPI: send logical pixels on Windows, backing pixels on macOS (#41)
  - `xrSetSharedTextureOutputRectEXT` takes HWND client-area pixels per spec
  - On DPI-aware Windows (Unity 6), `Screen.width` is already logical pixels
  - On macOS, `Screen.width` is in points — multiply by backing scale factor

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Fix shared texture format: use R8G8B8A8_UNORM / RGBA32 to match runtime weaver PSO format (#38)
  - Runtime hardcodes DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM (28) for the weaver; our shared texture was B8G8R8A8_UNORM (87)
  - Format mismatch caused weaver to silently no-op
  - Updated native standalone, preview session, preview window, and game view overlay

## [0.3.9] - 2026-03-25

### Changed
- Pass Unity's HWND to Win32 window binding for standalone preview — required by Leia weaver for correct window targeting (#38)

## [0.3.8] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Fix Windows DPI scaling for canvas rect: `get_backing_scale_factor` now returns system DPI / 96 instead of hardcoded 1.0 (#38)

## [0.3.7] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Fix atlas RT format: use BGRA32 to match bridge texture format for `Graphics.CopyTexture` compatibility (#38)

## [0.3.6] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Fix preview window not opening from menu (#40): null-guard custom editors to prevent `SerializedObjectNotCreatableException` during domain reload
- D3D11 TYPELESS swapchain textures: replace proxy texture copy with thin COM wrapper that overrides `GetDesc()` to report concrete format — zero-copy, no extra textures (#36)

## [0.3.5] - 2026-03-25

### Changed
- Cross-device atlas blit via DXGI shared bridge texture (#38)
  - Unity renders atlas on its D3D12 device, then `Graphics.CopyTexture` to a bridge texture shared on both devices
  - `CopyTextureRegion` from bridge to swapchain on the runtime's device
  - Completes the cross-device rendering pipeline started in 0.3.4

## [0.3.4] - 2026-03-25

### Changed
- D3D12: use separate device for runtime session, shared texture via DXGI handle for Unity (#35)
  - Sharing Unity's D3D12 device with the runtime caused device removal
  - Create dedicated D3D12 device for the runtime OpenXR session
  - Use `OpenSharedHandle` on Unity's device for `CreateExternalTexture`
  - Atlas blit skipped (cross-device TODO)

## [0.3.3] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- D3D12 atlas blit: remove explicit resource barriers, rely on implicit COMMON state promotion for cross-queue copy operations (#35)

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- D3D12 OpenXR struct type IDs: corrected from `1000027xxx` to `1000028xxx` (`XR_TYPE_GRAPHICS_BINDING_D3D12_KHR`, `XR_TYPE_SWAPCHAIN_IMAGE_D3D12_KHR`, `XR_TYPE_GRAPHICS_REQUIREMENTS_D3D12_KHR`) (#35)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Crash in `set_unity_device` on Windows D3D12: validate `ID3D12Resource` via `QueryInterface` before calling `GetDevice`, preventing access violation when Unity passes a non-D3D12 resource (#35)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-25

### Changed
- Migrate Windows standalone preview from D3D11 to D3D12 (#35)
  - Replace D3D11 device/context with D3D12 device/queue/command list/fence
  - D3D12 shared texture via `CreateCommittedResource` + `D3D12_HEAP_FLAG_SHARED`
  - Atlas blit with D3D12 command list, resource barriers, and fence sync
  - `XrGraphicsBindingD3D12KHR` for session creation
  - Platform-conditional Y-flip (Metal vs D3D12)
  - Supports both D3D11 and D3D12 Unity graphics backends

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- CS0104 ambiguous `Object` reference in `DisplayXRPreviewSession.cs` — qualify as `UnityEngine.Object` to resolve conflict with `System.Object` (#35)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- Null texture in `set_unity_device`: force `RenderTexture.Create()` before `GetNativeTexturePtr()` to ensure GPU resource is allocated (#35)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Windows standalone preview: use Unity's own D3D11 device instead of creating a separate one, fixing cross-device TDR crashes when sharing textures between devices (#35)

## [0.1.9] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Revert shared texture to B8G8R8A8_UNORM — runtime rejects TYPELESS format (`xrCreateSession` fails with -6). The C# `linear=true` flag is sufficient for correct gamma handling.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- D3D11 shared texture compatibility: use TYPELESS format with linear SRV to avoid gamma/format mismatch issues in the standalone preview rendering pipeline

## [0.1.7] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- Windows standalone preview: D3D11 swapchain image acquisition, atlas blit from shared texture, and `xrEndFrame` submission — completes the Windows standalone preview rendering pipeline

## [0.1.6] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- Windows crash: `displayxr_standalone_get_shared_texture` now returns `ID3D11Texture2D*` (what Unity's `CreateExternalTexture` expects) instead of the DXGI shared `HANDLE` (which is for cross-device sharing with the runtime)

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- Windows standalone preview: D3D11 shared texture creation and DXGI handle passing to runtime via Win32 window binding — enables zero-copy GPU texture sharing for preview output

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- Windows standalone preview: create D3D11 device with correct adapter LUID and pass `XrGraphicsBindingD3D11KHR` to session creation (fixes `xrCreateSession` error -38)

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- Windows standalone preview: implement `LoadLibrary`/`GetProcAddress` runtime loading and Win32 window binding for session creation — standalone preview now starts on Windows

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- Windows DLL plugin settings: enable Editor platform so standalone preview and Play Mode can load `displayxr_unity.dll` in the Windows editor

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- Standalone preview now discovers the runtime via Windows registry (`Khronos\OpenXR\1\ActiveRuntime`) when `XR_RUNTIME_JSON` is not set
- Settings page shows runtime discovery source (env var vs registry)
- UPM git URL install: added `.gitattributes` to prevent binary corruption, documented Git prerequisites for Windows and macOS
- Quick-start guide updated with git URL as primary install method

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-23
