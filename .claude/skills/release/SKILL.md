# Release Skill — DisplayXR Unity Plugin

Creates a tagged release of the Unity plugin, monitors `build-native.yml`, and verifies the GitHub Release, `upm` branch, and `upm/{version}` tag are all in place.

## Architecture

```
/release v0.8.0
  │
  ├─ Pre-flight checks (clean tree, on main, version valid)
  ├─ Bump version in package.json
  ├─ Add CHANGELOG.md entry
  ├─ Commit + create tag + push
  ├─ Monitor build-native.yml
  │    ├─ build-windows: Windows x64 native plugin
  │    ├─ build-macos:   macOS Universal native plugin
  │    └─ release:       UPM tarball + GitHub Release + upm branch + upm/{version} tag
  ├─ Verify GitHub Release exists with .tgz asset
  ├─ Verify upm branch updated
  └─ Report
```

## CRITICAL: Launch Subagent

**You MUST use the Agent tool with `subagent_type="general-purpose"` to execute this workflow.**

### Parsing the Version Argument

Parse `[ARGUMENTS]` to determine version:

1. If argument matches `vN.N.N` → use as explicit version
2. If argument is `patch` → read current version from `package.json`, bump patch (0.7.0 → 0.7.1)
3. If argument is `minor` → bump minor (0.7.0 → 0.8.0)
4. If argument is `major` → bump major (0.7.0 → 1.0.0)
5. If no argument → ask user what version

The git tag uses the `v` prefix (`v0.8.0`); the `package.json` version field does NOT (`0.8.0`).

### Subagent Prompt Template

Replace `[VERSION]` with the resolved version (e.g., `v0.8.0`) and `[VERSION_NUMBER]` with the version without the `v` prefix (e.g., `0.8.0`):

```
Execute the DisplayXR Unity plugin release workflow for version [VERSION].

## Configuration
- Repo: DisplayXR/displayxr-unity
- Workflow: build-native.yml
- Version source of truth: package.json "version" field
- Git tag format: v{major}.{minor}.{patch}
- UPM branch: upm (orphan, force-pushed each release with native binaries)
- UPM tag format: upm/v{major}.{minor}.{patch}

> ### Pre-release visibility check (transparent apps) — HARDWARE, do before tagging
> A transparent app was shipped **permanently invisible** on any no-runtime machine in
> v2.15.0–v2.16.1 (#295), and it passed CI + a 3D-path panel check both times, because a
> cloaked, off-screen window still runs, presents and pumps. **Before tagging a release
> that touches the transparent/overlay/pre-cloak path, run the visibility check on the box
> with the panel:**
> ```
> # build a transparent sample (desktop-avatar) against the release commit, then:
> tools~/visibility_check.ps1 -Exe <player.exe> -NoRuntime -GuardLog "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\<Company>\<Product>\Player.log"
> # (the #295 guard is a C# Debug.LogWarning -> Player.log, NOT displayxr.log; the tool pins DPI awareness itself)
> ```
> PASS requires a window that is visible AND not cloaked AND >200x200 AND on-screen, AND
> (with `-GuardLog`) that the plugin's own `#295` guard line fired — the 6th conjunct: an
> app may carry its own `IsInstalled` guard for this bug and pass the arm while the plugin
> guard never ran. This is a HARDWARE step (needs the box); it is not part of the CI build.
> Skipping it is how this class shipped twice.

## PHASE 1: PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS

### Step 1.0: Visibility gate (HARDWARE) — when the release touches the transparent path
This is the boxed warning above, promoted to a numbered step **because a note above
Phase 1 is easy to read past, and this class of bug shipped twice**. If any commit in
this release touches the transparent / overlay / cloak / pre-cloak path
(`DisplayXRTransparentOverlay*`, `displayxr_win32*`, the cloak/park code), build a
transparent sample against the release commit and run, on the box with the panel:
```
tools~/visibility_check.ps1 -Exe <player.exe> -NoRuntime -GuardLog "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\<Company>\<Product>\Player.log"
```
Exit 0 = shown. A non-zero exit STOPS the release. If the change cannot touch that
path, say so explicitly in the report rather than silently omitting it.

### Step 1.1: Verify clean state
Run: `git status --short`
- If dirty, report and STOP: "Working tree is not clean. Commit or stash changes first."

### Step 1.2: Verify on main branch
Run: `git branch --show-current`
- If not `main`, report and STOP: "Must be on main branch to release."

### Step 1.3: Verify version doesn't already exist
Run: `git tag -l "[VERSION]"`
- If tag exists, report and STOP: "Tag [VERSION] already exists."

### Step 1.4: Verify package.json current version
Read `package.json`. Extract `"version": "X.Y.Z"`.
- Confirm the resolved [VERSION_NUMBER] is greater than current.

### Step 1.5: Get previous tag for release notes
Run: `git tag --sort=-v:refname | grep '^v' | head -1`
Store as PREV_TAG.

---

## PHASE 2: UPDATE VERSION AND CHANGELOG

### Step 2.1: Bump package.json version — IDEMPOTENT, this is usually a NO-OP
Read `package.json`.
- If `"version"` is **already** `[VERSION_NUMBER]`, **change nothing**. This is the
  normal case in this repo, not an anomaly: the in-tree version is the version of
  record, so a feature PR bumps it *before* the release runs (CLAUDE.md: "bump
  `package.json` version per the repo rule").
- Otherwise Edit `"version": "X.Y.Z"` → `"version": "[VERSION_NUMBER]"`.

### Step 2.2: Add CHANGELOG.md entry — IDEMPOTENT, NEVER DUPLICATE A SECTION
Read CHANGELOG.md.
- **If a `## [[VERSION_NUMBER]]` section already exists, leave the file untouched**
  and skip the rest of this step. A feature PR that documented its own release
  section has already done this, and prepending a second one ships a changelog with
  the same version twice — wrong, and the duplicate is the one readers hit first.
- Otherwise, find the top header (after the file title).
Generate commit summary since PREV_TAG:
```bash
git log PREV_TAG..HEAD --oneline --no-merges
```
Group commits by prefix (feat/fix/docs/refactor/ci) and prepend a new section to CHANGELOG.md:
```
## [[VERSION_NUMBER]] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- ...

### Fixed
- ...

### Changed
- ...
```
Use today's date.

If unsure about grouping, just list all commits under "### Changed".

### Step 2.3: Commit the release — ALWAYS produce a `Release [VERSION]` commit
```bash
git add package.json CHANGELOG.md
git diff --cached --quiet \
  && git commit --allow-empty -m "Release [VERSION]" \
  || git commit -m "Release [VERSION]"
```
`git commit` fails on an empty index, so branch on whether anything is staged — but
**produce the `Release [VERSION]` commit either way, empty if need be**, by adding
`--allow-empty` on the nothing-staged path.

**This is the org-wide rule, not a local preference.** The runtime hub's
`/dxr-release` states it: *"Create a `Release vX.Y.Z` marker commit on the sibling's
`main` and tag THAT commit — same pattern as `/release` on the runtime, so every
repo's history shows an obvious release boundary (which release got which commits)."*
For most components that marker is empty because their version lives elsewhere.

**Unity is the exception: its marker is normally a REAL commit that bumps
`package.json`** — `package.json`'s `version` is Unity's version of record, read by
the website's org-sync `/platform-support` dashboard and resolved by UPM consumers.
`build-native.yml` patches the version into the `.tgz` and the `upm` branch *from the
tag* but never commits it back, so a `main` whose `package.json` still reads the
previous version makes the website wrong. That is why steps 2.1/2.2 above normally
DO the bump here rather than expecting a feature PR to have done it.

The `--allow-empty` path exists for the case where the bump already landed upstream —
then `main` is already correct and the marker is purely a history boundary. That is
what happened for v2.19.0: the feature PR carried the bump and the changelog, this
step had nothing to stage, an earlier revision of this skill therefore made no commit
at all, and the tag landed on an unrelated docs commit. Nothing shipped wrong — main
did show 2.19.0, so the website was right — but `git log` gave no sign the release
existed. Prefer letting THIS step do the bump; accept the empty marker when it
cannot, and never skip the commit entirely.

Store the commit SHA to match the CI run against: `git rev-parse HEAD`

### Step 2.4: Create tag and push
```bash
git tag [VERSION]
git push origin main
git push origin [VERSION]
```

---

## PHASE 3: MONITOR BUILD

### Step 3.1: Wait for build to register
Run: `sleep 15`

### Step 3.2: Find the build run
```bash
gh run list --workflow build-native.yml --limit 10 --json databaseId,status,headSha,displayTitle,event
```
Find the run matching your commit SHA (from Step 2.3) with event=push.
Retry up to 6 times with 10s waits.

### Step 3.3: Watch build
Run: `gh run watch RUN_ID --interval 15` (timeout 600000ms)

### Step 3.4: Check result
Run: `gh run view RUN_ID --json status,conclusion`
- If success: continue to Phase 3.5
- If failure: Go to PHASE 5 (Rollback)

---

## PHASE 3.5: CODE-SIGN THE WINDOWS NATIVE PLUGIN (capability-gated)

`displayxr_unity.dll` is the native plugin that loads into the Unity
player, so Smart App Control blocks it when unsigned. CI builds it on a
GitHub-hosted runner (UNSIGNED — the EV signing key lives on a self-hosted
build box, never in cloud CI, and this public repo names no signer). So a
signed release is produced by sending the CI-built DLL to a **remote
signing provider** and re-injecting the signed DLL into both distribution
channels.

The provider is named by the **`DXR_SIGN_REPO` local env var** (unset here →
unsigned; the public repo hardcodes no provider path). On the dev/release box
it's typically sourced from the runtime repo's `.env.local`
(`export DXR_SIGN_REPO=<owner/repo>`). The provider exposes a **`sign-artifact`**
folder hook: zip a folder of PEs → it signs every `.dll`/`.exe` on its
self-hosted EV box → returns a `signed` artifact. This flow is **OS-agnostic**
(runs from macOS / Linux / any Windows — no local cert, no `SIGN_CMD`), the same
primitive `/dxr-release` and `/installer-release` use. Contract: the runtime
repo's `docs/specs/runtime/release-signing.md`.

Signing does **not** rebuild — the CI-built DLL is signed in place inside the
`.tgz` release asset AND the `upm` orphan branch (git-URL installs read the DLL
from there). It **never gates publishing**: any failure leaves the unsigned CI
release and is flagged in the report. Re-running this against an already-released
version signs it in place — safe and idempotent — so a version cut without a
signer can be signed later by simply re-running `/release [VERSION]`.

### Step 3.5.1: Capability check
**Source the signer first.** `DXR_SIGN_REPO` is almost never already exported in a
fresh shell, and an unset value silently downgrades the release to unsigned — so read
it from the runtime repo's untracked `.env.local` before the check:
```bash
# Do NOT `source` the whole file (it holds other secrets); take only this one var.
# The line in .env.local is written `export DXR_SIGN_REPO=...` (it is meant to be
# sourced), so the grep MUST tolerate the `export ` prefix. A bare '^DXR_SIGN_REPO='
# matches nothing, the substitution yields "", and the release silently ships
# UNSIGNED on any box that has not already exported the var (caught on win, v2.19.1).
[ -z "$DXR_SIGN_REPO" ] && export DXR_SIGN_REPO=$(grep -m1 -E '^(export[[:space:]]+)?DXR_SIGN_REPO=' ~/Documents/GitHub/displayxr-runtime/.env.local 2>/dev/null | cut -d= -f2- | tr -d '"'"'"')
[ -z "$DXR_SIGN_REPO" ] && echo "WARN: DXR_SIGN_REPO still unset after sourcing .env.local — release will be UNSIGNED"
```

```bash
SIGN_REPO="${DXR_SIGN_REPO}"   # local env only; unset -> unsigned (public repo names no provider)
if [ -n "$SIGN_REPO" ] && gh workflow view sign-artifact -R "$SIGN_REPO" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  SIGNED=yes
else
  echo "⚠  SIGNING SKIPPED — DXR_SIGN_REPO unset in the env, or the provider is unreachable."
  echo "   The release DLL stays UNSIGNED. Set DXR_SIGN_REPO to a repo implementing"
  echo "   'sign-artifact' (e.g. source the runtime repo's .env.local), then re-run"
  echo "   /release [VERSION] — it detects the existing release and signs it in place."
  SIGNED=no   # continue — do not fail
fi
```

### Step 3.5.2: Sign the DLL via `sign-artifact`, re-inject into BOTH channels (if SIGNED=yes)
Fold **only** the DLL into a sign folder, hand it to the provider, then re-inject
the signed copy into the `.tgz` asset and the `upm` branch. Cleans up the temp
signing release on the provider regardless of outcome.
```bash
if [ "$SIGNED" = yes ]; then
  TGZ="com.displayxr.unity-[VERSION_NUMBER].tgz"
  DLL_REL="Runtime/Plugins/Windows/x64/displayxr_unity.dll"
  D=$(mktemp -d)

  # Pull the just-released .tgz and extract the CI-built (unsigned) DLL.
  gh release download [VERSION] -R DisplayXR/displayxr-unity -p "$TGZ" -D "$D"
  mkdir -p "$D/x"; tar xzf "$D/$TGZ" -C "$D/x"
  # NOTE: probe with `find`, never `ls`. Many git-bash profiles alias ls to
  # `ls -F`, which appends a classify char to the NAME (`/` for a directory,
  # `*` for an executable) — see the trap on SIGNED_DLL below.
  PKGDIR=$(find "$D/x" -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -name 'com.displayxr.unity-*' | head -1)
  [ -z "$PKGDIR" ] && PKGDIR="$D/x/package"
  DLL="$PKGDIR/$DLL_REL"

  SIGNED_DLL=""
  if [ ! -f "$DLL" ]; then
    echo "⚠ $DLL_REL not found in $TGZ — ships unsigned."; SIGNED=no
  else
    mkdir -p "$D/in"; cp "$DLL" "$D/in/"                       # fold ONLY the DLL into a sign folder
    # portable zip: git-bash on Windows has no `zip` — fall back to PowerShell.
    if command -v zip >/dev/null; then ( cd "$D/in" && zip -qr "$D/unsigned.zip" . )
    else powershell -NoProfile -Command "Compress-Archive -Path '$(cygpath -w "$D/in")\*' -DestinationPath '$(cygpath -w "$D/unsigned.zip")' -Force"; fi

    # NOTE: name this SIGN_TAG, never TMP. `TMP` is an exported env var on
    # git-bash/Windows (Go's os.TempDir() reads %TMP%), so assigning to it
    # repoints every child process's temp dir at a relative path — and
    # `gh run download` below then dies with "error initializing temporary
    # file: open <cwd>\sign-unity-...\gh-artifact.zip: The system cannot find
    # the path specified", leaving the release silently unsigned (and littering
    # an empty sign-unity-* dir in the cwd). Windows-only: macOS/Linux Go reads
    # TMPDIR, so this never repros on the mac box.
    SIGN_TAG="sign-unity-$(date +%s)-$$"
    gh release create "$SIGN_TAG" -R "$SIGN_REPO" --prerelease --title "$SIGN_TAG" \
       --notes "temp unity-signing payload (auto-deleted)" "$D/unsigned.zip"
    SINCE="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
    gh workflow run sign-artifact -R "$SIGN_REPO" -f release_tag="$SIGN_TAG"
    RID=""
    for _ in $(seq 1 20); do
      RID=$(gh run list -R "$SIGN_REPO" --workflow sign-artifact --event workflow_dispatch \
              --limit 8 --json databaseId,createdAt \
              --jq "[.[]|select(.createdAt>=\"$SINCE\")]|sort_by(.createdAt)|last|.databaseId // empty")
      [ -n "$RID" ] && break; sleep 4
    done
    if [ -n "$RID" ] && gh run watch "$RID" -R "$SIGN_REPO" --interval 15 --exit-status; then
      gh run download "$RID" -R "$SIGN_REPO" -n signed -D "$D/out"
      # portable unzip (git-bash on Windows has no `unzip`).
      if command -v unzip >/dev/null; then ( cd "$D/out" && unzip -qo signed.zip -d "$D/signed" 2>/dev/null || true )
      else powershell -NoProfile -Command "Expand-Archive -Path '$(cygpath -w "$D/out/signed.zip")' -DestinationPath '$(cygpath -w "$D/signed")' -Force"; fi
      # NOTE: test the path directly — do NOT probe it with `ls`. A git-bash
      # profile that aliases ls to `ls -F` makes `ls <file>` print
      # "displayxr_unity.dll*" (trailing classify char for an executable), so
      # SIGNED_DLL comes back NON-EMPTY — the "did not return a signed DLL"
      # guard below passes — yet every later `cp "$SIGNED_DLL"` dies with
      # "cannot stat", the .tgz is repacked with the UNSIGNED CI DLL, the upm
      # commit is a no-op, and the script still prints the ✅ signed line.
      # This silently shipped an unsigned v2.14.0 on the win box before it was
      # caught by hand. Same class of trap as the TMP one above.
      SIGNED_DLL=""
      [ -f "$D/signed/displayxr_unity.dll" ] && SIGNED_DLL="$D/signed/displayxr_unity.dll"
    fi
    gh release delete "$SIGN_TAG" -R "$SIGN_REPO" --yes --cleanup-tag >/dev/null 2>&1 || true

    if [ -z "$SIGNED_DLL" ]; then
      echo "⚠ sign-artifact did not return a signed DLL — ships unsigned."; SIGNED=no
    else
      # Channel 1 — repack the .tgz with the signed DLL, re-upload over the asset.
      cp "$SIGNED_DLL" "$DLL"
      ( cd "$D/x" && tar czf "$D/$TGZ" "$(basename "$PKGDIR")" )
      gh release upload [VERSION] "$D/$TGZ" --clobber -R DisplayXR/displayxr-unity

      # Channel 2 — put the signed DLL on the `upm` branch + move its version tag.
      # CI already force-pushed `upm` with the unsigned DLL; layer the signed one on top.
      git fetch origin upm --quiet && git checkout -B upm origin/upm
      cp "$SIGNED_DLL" "$DLL_REL"; git add -f "$DLL_REL"
      git commit -q -m "Sign displayxr_unity.dll for [VERSION] (Leia EV)" || echo "(upm already signed)"
      git push -f origin upm
      git tag -f "upm/[VERSION]" && git push -f origin "upm/[VERSION]"
      git checkout main
      echo "✅ signed displayxr_unity.dll re-injected into the .tgz asset + upm branch (Valid/Leia EV)."
    fi
  fi
  rm -rf "$D"
fi
```

### Step 3.5.3: Verify the SHIPPED bytes (REQUIRED when SIGNED=yes)
Never report "signed" off the script's own success line — re-download what the
world will actually install and check it. Both channels:
```bash
V=$(mktemp -d); mkdir -p "$V/x"
gh release download [VERSION] -R DisplayXR/displayxr-unity -p "com.displayxr.unity-[VERSION_NUMBER].tgz" -D "$V"
tar xzf "$V/com.displayxr.unity-[VERSION_NUMBER].tgz" -C "$V/x"
powershell -NoProfile -Command "(Get-AuthenticodeSignature '$(cygpath -w "$V/x/com.displayxr.unity-[VERSION_NUMBER]/Runtime/Plugins/Windows/x64/displayxr_unity.dll")').Status"
git cat-file -p "origin/upm:Runtime/Plugins/Windows/x64/displayxr_unity.dll" > "$V/upm.dll"
powershell -NoProfile -Command "(Get-AuthenticodeSignature '$(cygpath -w "$V/upm.dll")').Status"
rm -rf "$V"
```
Both must print `Valid` (signer `Leia, Inc.`). Anything else → report SIGNED=no,
whatever the script above claimed. (On macOS/Linux use `osslsigncode verify`.)

Note: the macOS `displayxr_unity.bundle` is signed with an Apple
Developer ID cert + notarization (a separate track from the Windows EV
cert) — out of scope here; flag it as macOS-unsigned in the report.
Carry `SIGNED` into the final report.

---

## PHASE 4: VERIFY AND REPORT

### Step 4.1: Verify GitHub Release exists
```bash
gh release view [VERSION] --repo DisplayXR/displayxr-unity --json tagName,name,assets
```
- Verify tag exists, release was created, `.tgz` asset is attached (`com.displayxr.unity-[VERSION_NUMBER].tgz`)

### Step 4.2: Verify upm branch and tag
```bash
git ls-remote origin refs/heads/upm
git ls-remote origin refs/tags/upm/[VERSION]
```
- Verify both exist

### Step 4.3: Report
```
DisplayXR Unity [VERSION] published successfully!

Build:
  - Windows x64:  PASSED
  - macOS Universal: PASSED
  - Release job: PASSED (run #RUN_ID)

Signing:  [SIGNED=yes → "displayxr_unity.dll signed (Leia EV) on the provider runner and re-injected into the .tgz asset + upm branch"] | [SIGNED=no → "⚠ Windows DLL UNSIGNED — DXR_SIGN_REPO unset/unreachable; set it and re-run /release [VERSION] to sign in place"]  (macOS .bundle: unsigned — separate Apple Developer ID track)

Published to:
  - GitHub Release: https://github.com/DisplayXR/displayxr-unity/releases/tag/[VERSION]
  - UPM branch: https://github.com/DisplayXR/displayxr-unity/tree/upm
  - UPM tag: https://github.com/DisplayXR/displayxr-unity/tree/upm/[VERSION]

Install in Unity (Package Manager → Add from git URL):
  https://github.com/DisplayXR/displayxr-unity.git#upm/[VERSION]

Changelog:
  [generated changelog summary]
```

STOP.

---

## PHASE 5: ROLLBACK (on build failure)

### Step 5.1: Delete tag
```bash
git tag -d [VERSION]
git push --delete origin [VERSION]
```

### Step 5.2: Revert version bump
```bash
git revert HEAD --no-edit
git push origin main
```

### Step 5.3: Get error logs
Run: `gh run view RUN_ID --log-failed | tail -200`

### Step 5.4: Report
```
DisplayXR Unity [VERSION] release FAILED — rolled back.

Error from build:
[error summary]

Tag, version bump, and CHANGELOG entry have been reverted.
Fix the issue and try again with /release [VERSION]
```

STOP.
```
