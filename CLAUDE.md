This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## Project Overview

Unity plugin for eye-tracked 3D light field displays via the **DisplayXR OpenXR runtime**. This is a Unity Package Manager (UPM) package that intercepts Unity's OpenXR pipeline at the native layer to provide Kooima asymmetric frustum projection for stereo rendering. The primary editor workflow is a **standalone preview window** that creates its own OpenXR session — no Play Mode needed.

The plugin works with the **openxr-3d-display** runtime ([dfattal/openxr-3d-display](https://github.com/dfattal/openxr-3d-display)) but has **no source dependency** on it — native code fetches OpenXR headers independently from Khronos.

## Repository Structure

This repo root IS the UPM package root (`package.json` is at the top level).

```

```

## Building the Native Plugin

```bash
cd native~
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . --config Release
```

Output: `displayxr_unity.dll` (Windows) or `libdisplayxr_unity.dylib` (macOS).

Copy built binary to `Runtime/Plugins/Windows/x64/` or `Runtime/Plugins/macOS/`.

### Local builds

**macOS (native, produces shipping binary):**
```bash
native~/build-mac.sh
```
Builds Universal binary (x86_64 + arm64) → `Runtime/Plugins/macOS/displayxr_unity.bundle`.

**Windows (native MSVC, produces shipping binary):**
```bat
native~\build-win.bat
```
Builds x64 DLL with MSVC → `Runtime/Plugins/Windows/x64/displayxr_unity.dll`. Requires Visual Studio 2022 (or Build Tools) with the "Desktop development with C++" workload. Run from a Developer Command Prompt or any shell with MSVC on PATH.

**Windows (MinGW cross-compile, compile check only):**
```bash
native~/build-win.sh
```
Verifies the code compiles for Windows but the DLL stays in `build-win/` (MinGW ABI, not shipped). For native Windows builds, use `build-win.bat` instead.

**Claude Code: After modifying any file in `native~/`, always run the local build script for the current platform — `native~/build-mac.sh` on macOS or `native~\build-win.bat` on Windows — to update the shipping binary. On macOS, also run `native~/build-win.sh` as a cross-compile check. Use `/ci-monitor` to commit, push, and verify CI builds both platforms.**

## Key Architecture

### Three Layers

1. **Runtime (C#)** — `DisplayXRFeature.cs` hooks into OpenXR lifecycle; `DisplayXRCamera.cs` and `DisplayXRDisplay.cs` are the two stereo rig modes; `DisplayXRRigManager.cs` coordinates multi-camera scenes; `DisplayXRPreview.cs` provides inline preview textures (SBS, readback, SharedTexture)
2. **Editor (C#)** — Custom inspectors, settings page, and the standalone preview system (`DisplayXRPreviewSession.cs` manages an independent OpenXR session; `DisplayXRPreviewWindow.cs` provides the editor UI with camera selector and rendering mode controls)
3. **Native (C/C++)** — Hook chain on `xrLocateViews`, `xrCreateSession`, `xrGetSystemProperties`, `xrEndFrame`; Kooima projection math; thread-safe shared state

### Key Features

- **Two stereo rig modes**: Camera-centric (`DisplayXRCamera` — inherits camera FOV, inv. convergence distance tunable) and display-centric (`DisplayXRDisplay` — physical display geometry, virtual display height, scale-as-zoom)
- **Multi-camera support**: Multiple rigs coexist in one scene; `DisplayXRRigManager` coordinates which rig is active (see below)
- **Standalone editor preview**: Own OpenXR session bypassing Unity XR. Camera selector dropdown, dynamic rendering mode enumeration, zero-copy SharedTexture output (IOSurface/DXGI). Replaces Play Mode for DisplayXR workflows.
- **Play Mode conflict prevention**: Preview auto-removes Unity's OpenXR loader on Play entry, restores on exit (saved via SessionState)
- **2D UI overlay**: Canvas → `XrCompositionLayerWindowSpaceEXT` with stereo disparity
- **Native Kooima math**: `display3d_view.c` (screen-edge frustum) and `camera3d_view.c` (tangent-space frustum) — pure C, no DisplayXR dependency

### Multi-Camera Rig Management

Scenes can contain multiple cameras with different rig types (display-centric, camera-centric, or plain cameras). A static registry coordinates which rig is active at any time.

**`DisplayXRRigManager`** (static class, no scene object needed):
- Rigs self-register in `OnEnable`, self-deregister in `OnDisable`
- First registered camera is auto-elected as `ActiveCamera`
- `CycleNext()` advances to the next registered camera (used by Tab key)
- `ActiveCamera` property is the single source of truth for rig gating and input

**Rig gating**: `DisplayXRDisplay.LateUpdate()` and `DisplayXRCamera.LateUpdate()` check `DisplayXRRigManager.ActiveCamera` before pushing tunables to the native hook chain. Only the active rig pushes — prevents multi-rig conflicts (wrong projection, FOV feedback loops).

**Input isolation**: `DisplayXRInputController.IsActiveCamera()` returns true only for the active camera's controller. Inactive controllers clear their drag state to prevent rotation jumps on reactivation.

**Component reference:**

| Component | Required | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `DisplayXRDisplay` | One of | Display-centric stereo rig (scale-as-zoom) |
| `DisplayXRCamera` | One of | Camera-centric stereo rig (FOV-based) |
| `DisplayXRRigManager` | Automatic | Static camera registry — no scene object, rigs self-register |
| `DisplayXRInputController` | Optional | Sample WASD/mouse/scroll controller. Tab cycles cameras via `DisplayXRRigManager.CycleNext()`. Developers typically replace this with their own input. |
| `DisplayXRGameViewOverlay` | Optional | Editor play-mode only: draws shared texture in Game View, suppresses scene rendering. Not needed in built apps. |

### OpenXR Hook Chain

The native plugin intercepts OpenXR calls via `xrGetInstanceProcAddr` hooking:
- `xrLocateViews` → applies scene transform + tunables + Kooima projection
- `xrCreateSession` → injects window binding extension
- `xrGetSystemProperties` → extracts display info
- `xrEndFrame` → submits overlay composition layers

### Shared Texture Architecture (IOSurface / DXGI)

The compositor shares a GPU texture with the Unity plugin for preview and game overlay output. Two consumers display this texture:

- **Standalone Preview Window** (`Editor/DisplayXRPreviewWindow.cs`) — EditorWindow, no Play Mode
- **Game View Overlay** (`Runtime/DisplayXRGameViewOverlay.cs`) — MonoBehaviour, Play Mode

**IOSurface / shared texture contract:**

| Property | Value | Source |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Texture size | Display pixel dimensions (worst-case) | Created once at session start, never resized |
| Content region | Top-left corner, canvas.w × canvas.h | App decides canvas, tells runtime |
| UV crop | (canvasW / surfaceW, canvasH / surfaceH) | App computes from known dims |
| Letterbox aspect | canvasW / canvasH | Canvas aspect, not surface aspect |

**Flow each frame:**
1. App computes canvas = view area in backing pixels (preview rect or Screen size)
2. App calls `xrSetSharedTextureOutputRectEXT(session, x, y, w, h)` via `displayxr_standalone_set_canvas_rect()` — tells the runtime where to render and at what size
3. Runtime/compositor writes interlaced output to IOSurface at (0, 0, canvasW, canvasH)
4. App creates `Texture2D.CreateExternalTexture()` at full IOSurface dims, but samples only the canvas portion via UV scaling: `Rect(0, vMax, uMax, -vMax)` (Y-flipped for Metal)
5. App letterboxes using canvas aspect ratio (since canvas = view size, typically no letterbox)

**Screen position (x, y):** Required for pixel-precise interlacing alignment on lenticular displays. The runtime uses this internally in the Display Processor — the app doesn't need it back.

### Wire Protocol

Extension struct definitions in `native~/displayxr_extensions.h` must match the runtime's implementation. These are versioned by extension spec version. When changing extensions, update the runtime first, then the plugin.

## Development Workflow

### Testing in Unity

1. Open any Unity 2022.3+ project
2. Add this package via Package Manager (local path or git URL)
3. Enable the feature: Project Settings > XR Plug-in Management > OpenXR > DisplayXR
4. Set `XR_RUNTIME_JSON` environment variable to point to a DisplayXR runtime build (or use `SIM_DISPLAY_ENABLE=1 SIM_DISPLAY_OUTPUT=sbs` for testing without hardware)
5. **Open Window > DisplayXR > Preview Window, click Start** — this is the primary workflow
6. Play Mode still works but the standalone preview is preferred (avoids XR session conflicts)

### Critical: OpenXR Package Version

**You MUST use `com.unity.xr.openxr` version 1.16.1 or later.** The minimum version in `package.json` is 1.9.1 for broad compatibility, but versions before 1.16.1 ignore the `XR_RUNTIME_JSON` environment variable and the system `active_runtime.json` in editor play mode — they silently fall back to Unity's built-in Mock Runtime. This causes `0x0` display resolution, no IOSurface/shared texture, and no display info from the runtime. The failure is silent (no error logged, just mock runtime loaded). Always pin `1.16.1+` in your test project's `Packages/manifest.json`.

### Code Style

- C# follows Unity conventions (PascalCase for public members, camelCase for private)
- C/C++ follows the DisplayXR coding style (snake_case, C11/C++17)
- Native code in `native~/` uses tabs for indentation

## CI and Releases

### Day-to-day: just push to main
Every push to `main` that touches `native~/` triggers `build-native.yml`, which builds the DLL (Windows x64) and bundle (macOS Universal) and uploads them as CI artifacts. No tags, no releases. Artifacts are available for 90 days.

C#-only changes don't trigger the workflow (path filter).

### Creating a release (when ready)
Releases are triggered **only** by manually pushing a `v*` tag:
```bash
# 1. Make sure main is clean and CI passes
# 2. Bump version in package.json if needed
# 3. Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
# 4. Tag and push:
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

This triggers the `release` job in CI which:
- Builds both platform binaries
- Creates a `.tgz` UPM tarball with binaries included
- Pushes a `upm` branch with binaries committed (for git URL installs)
- Creates a `upm/v0.1.0` tag for version-pinned installs
- Publishes a GitHub Release with changelog notes and the `.tgz` attached

### Fixing a bad release
Tags are cheap and deletable:
```bash
git tag -d v0.1.0                     # delete local
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.1.0     # delete remote
# delete the GitHub Release in the web UI
# fix the issue, then re-tag
```

### Install paths for users

| Method | URL | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------|
| Git URL (latest release) | `...git#upm` | Tracks latest release |
| Git URL (pinned version) | `...git#upm/v0.1.0` | For production |
| Tarball | Download `.tgz` from Releases page | Offline installs |
| Local dev | Clone repo + build `native~/` yourself | For contributors |

The `upm` branch and release tarball only exist after the first `v*` tag is pushed.

## Claude Code Skills

### /ci-monitor - Automated Build Workflow
Automates the complete CI workflow for native plugin builds: commit → push → monitor → auto-fix.

**Usage:**
```bash
/ci-monitor "commit message"    # Commit with message and monitor build
/ci-monitor                      # Auto-generate commit message from changes
/ci-monitor --watch-only         # Just monitor current build without committing
```

**Features:**
- Launches subagent to preserve main conversation context
- Monitors GitHub Actions `build-native.yml` (Windows x64 + macOS Universal)
- Auto-diagnoses common build errors (missing includes, undeclared identifiers, linker errors)
- Attempts up to 3 automatic fixes before reporting failure
- Detects when only C# files changed (no native build triggered)

**Important:** Always include the related GitHub issue number in commit messages — e.g., `Fix linker error (#93)`. Check conversation context and recent commits to determine the issue number.
